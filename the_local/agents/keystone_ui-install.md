This local carries the steps for wiring Keystone UI into a host app. Follow them
in order, exactly as written, and invent none.

## What Keystone UI is

A Rails engine gem that supplies an app's visual layer as `ui_*` view helpers
built on ViewComponent; hook it in before building any screen with those helpers.

## Interface

- `bin/rails generate keystone:install` — sets up the host's Tailwind entry
  point, registers the gem's Stimulus controllers, and adds the theme attributes
  to the layout's `<html>` tag. Safe to re-run.
- `KeystoneUi.configure` — a block yielding the configuration: `accent` and
  `surface` (palette names, `:blue` and `:zinc` unless set),
  `theme_mode_supplier` (a callable that supplies a light, dark, system or
  custom mode),
  and the `tailwind_imports` and `tailwind_sources` lists (extra CSS files and
  scan paths added to the Tailwind build).

## How to use it

1. Confirm the prerequisites: Ruby >= 3.2 and **tailwindcss-rails v4+** in the
   host app. The gem brings ViewComponent and keystone_ui-styles with it.
   Tailwind does not have to be initialized first, because the generator creates
   the stylesheet if it is missing.

2. Add the gem to the Gemfile and install it:

   ```ruby
   gem "keystone_ui"
   ```

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

   If the project sources its own gems from somewhere other than RubyGems (a git
   or path reference), ask the developer which to use rather than choosing.

3. Run the generator:

   ```bash
   bin/rails generate keystone:install
   ```

   It touches three host files:

   - `app/assets/tailwind/application.css` — if absent, it is created holding
     `@import "tailwindcss";` and `@import "./keystone_source.css";`. If present,
     the Keystone import is added on the line after `@import "tailwindcss";`, and
     Keystone lines left by older installs are removed.
   - `app/javascript/controllers/index.js` — appends
     `import { registerControllers } from "keystone_ui/index"` and
     `registerControllers(application)`.
   - `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` — adds
     `<%= keystone_theme_attributes %>` inside the `<html` tag, which writes the
     light, dark or custom mode onto the page.

   Read its output for two warnings:

   - `app/javascript/controllers/index.js not found` — ask the developer where
     the Stimulus application is set up and add those two lines there. Without
     them, dropdowns, modals, file uploads, the column picker, the theme toggle
     and the other interactive components do nothing.
   - `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb not found` — ask the developer which
     layout the app renders and add `<%= keystone_theme_attributes %>` to its
     `<html>` tag. Without it, a saved light or dark choice is not applied when
     the page loads.

   The CSS step only adds the Keystone import if `application.css` contains the
   exact line `@import "tailwindcss";` followed by a line break. If the output
   says nothing about the import and the line is not in the file, add
   `@import "./keystone_source.css";` directly under the Tailwind import by hand.

4. Restart the app (or rebuild assets). On boot the engine writes
   `app/assets/tailwind/keystone_source.css`, which imports the gem's theme and
   component CSS and points Tailwind at the component files. It is written only
   when `application.css` exists **and** contains
   `@import "./keystone_source.css";`, so if the file never appears, that import
   is missing.

5. Keep the generated file out of git. It holds absolute paths to the gem on the
   machine that booted the app, and is rewritten on every boot, which includes
   the dev server, CI and `assets:precompile`. Add to `.gitignore`:

   ```
   app/assets/tailwind/keystone_source.css
   ```

   Only the `@import` line in `application.css` belongs in the repo.

6. Settle the palette. Without configuration the accent scale is blue and the
   surface scale is zinc. To change them statically, add an `@theme` block to
   `application.css` **after** the two imports and override only the shades the
   app uses:

   ```css
   @import "tailwindcss";
   @import "./keystone_source.css";

   @theme {
     --color-accent-500: #6366f1;
     --color-accent-600: #4f46e5;
   }
   ```

   Both scales run 50 through 950. Every component picks the values up with no
   component changes.

   This is a decision to put to the developer: fixed app-wide colors set in CSS,
   or per-user colors generated at runtime by a companion theming gem. Ask which
   the app wants before wiring either.

7. Write `config/initializers/keystone_ui.rb` only if one of the settings below
   is wanted. Ask the developer about each rather than adding any by default.
   The engine reads the configuration after initializers have run, so this file
   is where the block goes.

   ```ruby
   require "keystone_ui"

   KeystoneUi.configure do |config|
     config.accent = :emerald
     config.surface = :slate
     config.theme_mode_supplier = ->(view) { view.current_user&.theme }
     config.tailwind_imports << "/absolute/path/to/extra.css"
     config.tailwind_sources << "/absolute/path/to/components/**/*.{erb,rb}"
   end
   ```

   - `accent` and `surface` — set these only when a companion gem or engine
     reads the palette choice. Keystone UI stores the names and changes no color
     from them, because colors come from the CSS custom properties in step 6.
   - `theme_mode_supplier` — a callable that receives the view and returns
     `"light"`, `"dark"`, `"system"`, `"custom"` or `nil`. It supplies the mode
     when the user has not picked one with the theme toggle, since the
     `keystone_theme` cookie that the toggle writes takes precedence. Any other
     return value, or no supplier, falls back to light.
   - A supplied `"custom"` marks the layout's `<html>` tag
     `data-theme="custom"`. The theme toggle does not offer custom, so only a
     supplier sets it. Ask the developer which gem or code supplies custom and
     its colors before returning it.
   - `tailwind_imports` and `tailwind_sources` — lists to append to, never
     assign. Each import becomes an `@import` line and each source becomes an
     `@source` line in `keystone_source.css` on the next boot. They are for
     another gem or engine whose CSS or templates must be in the same Tailwind
     build, and that gem normally appends its own entries.

## Conventions

- **Verify the install before building anything on it.** Check four things:
  `application.css` holds both imports, `app/assets/tailwind/keystone_source.css`
  exists after a boot, the Stimulus setup calls `registerControllers(application)`,
  and the layout's `<html>` tag contains `<%= keystone_theme_attributes %>`. Then
  load one page that renders a `ui_*` helper and confirm it is styled and that an
  interactive component (a dropdown, a dismissible alert) responds.
- **Importmap is the supported JS path.** For apps configured with importmap the
  gem pins its own controllers, and the charting library they need, on boot, so
  the host pins nothing. If the app bundles JavaScript instead (esbuild, bun,
  webpack), the appended `keystone_ui/index` import has nothing pinned behind
  it. Tell the developer rather than guessing at a bundler configuration.
- **Re-run the generator after upgrading the gem.** It removes superseded install
  lines and reports that each file is already up to date when there is nothing
  to do.
- **New components need no re-run.** Tailwind rescans the gem on each build, so
  components added by a later version are styled on the next boot.
- On boot the engine deletes `app/assets/builds/tailwind/keystone_ui_engine.css`
  if an older install left it there. Do not recreate it.
- Building UI with the helpers, including which helper to use and what keywords
  it takes, is out of scope here and belongs to `keystone_ui-develop`.
